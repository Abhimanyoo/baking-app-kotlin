# Udacity Honor Code

    I confirm that this submission is my own work. I have not used code from 
	any other Udacity student's or graduate's submission of the same project. 
	I have correctly attributed all code I have obtained from other sources, 
	such as websites, books, forums, blogs, GitHub repos, etc. I understand 
	that Udacity will check my submission for plagiarism, and that failure 
	to adhere to the Udacity Honor Code may result in the cancellation of my
	enrollment.
